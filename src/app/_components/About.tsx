      <p className="my-2">
        As a Fullstack Developer and seasoned Software Development Engineer in
        Test (SDET), I specialize in building robust, scalable web applications
        with a keen eye for quality and maintainability. Leveraging expertise
        across frontend frameworks and backend technologies, I design and
        deliver end-to-end solutions that not only meet business goals but also

      <p className="my-2">
        My approach integrates development best practices with quality
        engineering principles â€” from clean, modular code to comprehensive
        automated testing and continuous integration/deployment pipelines. I
        believe quality starts with thoughtful design and is ensured through
        meticulous testing, monitoring, and collaboration with cross-functional
        teams.

        Passionate about crafting seamless user experiences and resilient
        systems, I thrive on solving complex problems and driving innovation in
        fast-paced environments. Whether working on new feature development or
        empowering test automation strategies, I consistently focus on
        delivering high-impact software that scales efficiently and performs
        flawlessly.
