The tool fetches images asynchronously for faster performance, while respecting each site's robots.txt rules. It also includes built-in rate limiting to avoid overwhelming servers.

You can run it with a simple configuration file for repeatable setups, or pass options directly through CLI arguments for quick one-off scrapes.`}
